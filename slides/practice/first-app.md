## My first SBCP app

* Make sure that our local environment is [setup](https://developers.sbcp.io/docs/current/development-guide/quickstart/environment-setup/)
* Create a new SBCP application (hint: use [SBCP's CLI](https://innersource.soprasteria.com/dxp/dxp-core/common-librairies/dxp-cli))
* When starting application make sure `dev` [profile is set](https://developers.sbcp.io/docs/current/development-guide/quickstart/environment-setup/#sbcp-common-libraries).
* Publish an API endpoint '`/hello/{name}`' that returns when called '`Hello YOUR_NAME`'
* Once it's done, in a new directory clone the following repository: `https://innersource.soprasteria.com/dxp/training/training-teams.git`
