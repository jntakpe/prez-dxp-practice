## Reactive service

* Checkout tag `java-service-reactive` or `kotlin-service-reactive`
* Transform the existing blocking `TeamService` into a reactive service
    * Hint: edit the repository to return reactive object
    * Hint: reading Reactor's [documentation](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/) can help 
    especially the chapter dedicated to [error handling](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#error.handling)
    * Actions performed by the service should be logged
    * To make sure you have implemented the desired behaviour executing unit tests
