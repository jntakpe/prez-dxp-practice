## My first SBCP app

* Make sure that our local environment is [setup](http://training-api.dxp.delivery/documentation/setup/)
* Create a new SBCP application (hint: use [SBCP's CLI](https://innersource.soprasteria.com/dxp/dxp-core/common-librairies/dxp-cli))
* When starting application make sure `dev` [profile is set](http://training-api.dxp.delivery/documentation/setup/#sbcp-common-libraries).
* Publish an API endpoint '`/hello/{name}`' that returns when called '`Hello YOUR_NAME`'
