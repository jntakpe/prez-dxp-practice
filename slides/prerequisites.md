## Prerequisites

Follow [SBCP's setup documentation](https://training-api.dxp.delivery/documentation/setup/) to get started.

During the presentation, I will be using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), it is advised to use the 
same IDE but if you feel more confident with another IDE, you can use it.
